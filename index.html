<p>Two players share an unbiased coin and take it in turns to play "The Race".</p>
<p>On Player 1's turn, they tosses the coin once: if it comes up Heads, they scores one point; if it comes up Tails, they scores nothing.</p>
<p>On Player 2's turn, they chooses a positive integer T and tosses the coin T times: if it comes up all Heads, they scores 2^(T-1) points; otherwise, they scores nothing.</p>
<p>Player 1 goes first. The winner is the first to 100 or more points.</p>
